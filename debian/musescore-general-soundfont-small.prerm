# * prerm "remove"
# * old-prerm "upgrade" $new_version
# * conflictors-prerm "remove" "in-favour" $new_package $new_version
# * deconfigureds-prerm "deconfigure" "in-favour"

#	["removing" $conflicting_package $cp_version]	# old-package
# The package and dependencies are at least Half-Installed; dependencies
# have previously been configured and not removed.

# * new-prerm "failed-upgrade" $old_version
# * new-prerm "failed-upgrade" $old_version $new_version # 1.18.5, stretch
# Called when 'old-prerm "upgrade"' fails; new package not unpacked, all
# other constraints the same as above.
